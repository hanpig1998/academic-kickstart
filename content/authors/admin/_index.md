I am a final-year undergraduate student from [Department of Automation](http://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018/index.html). I also minor in statistics at [Center for Statistical Science](http://www.stat.tsinghua.edu.cn/).

My research interests lie in the general area of machine learning, particularly in reinforcement learning. I am interested in both deep reinforcement learning and [Statistical Reinforcement Learning](https://nanjiang.cs.illinois.edu/cs598/). Currently I am focusing on representational learning in reinforcement learning. I am also carrying out research on lifelong learning.

In Summer, 2019, I was a summer intern at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, advised by Professor [Nan Jiang](https://nanjiang.cs.illinois.edu/). In Tsinghua University, I am an undergraduate researcher in [IVG Lab](http://ivg.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/people.php), advised by Professor [Jiwen Lu](http://ivg.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/Jiwen_Lu/). Currently I am going on with my undergraduate thesis, advised by Professor [Gao Huang](http://www.gaohuang.net/).
